Project using Transformers

In today's digital age, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news poses a significant challenge to society. To combat this issue, I propose a project aimed at tackling fake news through data-driven approaches. Using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, this system will evaluate the credibility of news sources and the accuracy of their content, empowering users to make informed decisions about the information they consume. This project seeks to mitigate the spread of misinformation, promoting media literacy and fostering a more informed society.
